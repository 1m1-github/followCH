in the US, imo, the biggest fear everyone lives under, is gun violence...I have realized a solution (surely I am not the first)...a good solution, though of course difficult to implement, but possible...I will eventually publish it...it is called "follow Switzerland": guns need license, almost every household has a gun via a military license via mandatory service....why does this work:
- pro gun ppl want to protect vs tyrannical government...that is important, however, actually, military protects against that, i.e. decides who rules, i.e. to uphold democracy in the US...no militia can win vs army
- organized 3 month service after high school for all connects and strengthens the country...ppl can do modern, useful things instead of crawling through mud... everyone gets more fit, more bonded (cohesive), learns some skill, economy improves etc....plus a week yearly
- each weapon can be summarized by its lethality...this gives a spectrum of for weapons... society decides where the licensing threshold lies...debate is around the guns level, where a spike of lethality is.... require licensing for guns means only people that learned usage carry guns (sports gunners, hunters, military, police)....but now almost every household has someone licensed for a gun....no random criminals or teenagers etc.
- gun industry should keep producing, but mainly for military 
- left wants to restrict guns, right wants to have stronger military
- true democracy is democracy of power, which truly lies in the military (hence CH works so well)
- buyback guns over time with decreasing value over time, with minimal value guaranteed / increase punishment for crime with gun over time with max for humane punishment... in a few years, all/most gun violence will be of the past
- society will thrive in other ways by loosing source of largest stress (will my kid die in a school shooting)
- imagine how strong the US could be if it's citizens were more cohesive via such networking...a new lease on becoming the strongest society
-  to explain that a license threshold is needed (fists need to be license free, bio weapons need to be licensed=>threshold is somewhere in between)...and that it is the military that protects democracy, not random militias....to protect vs the tyranny of a military, again, military=the people is the solution....you cannot coup against yourself

- how many in US/CH are part of military?
- how many days per year served?
- pay instead of serve
- sex neutral
